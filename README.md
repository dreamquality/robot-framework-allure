# Robot Framework Project

This project is an example of a Robot Framework test automation setup, implementing best practices including:
- Page Object Model (POM)
- Parameterization of tests
- Parallel execution with Pabot
- Integration with Allure for reporting

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running Tests

**Quick syntax validation (recommended first step):**
```bash
python robot_settings.py --dryrun
```

**Run full tests with browser automation:**
```bash
python robot_settings.py
```

**Alternative commands:**
```bash
# Direct robot command
robot --outputdir reports tests/

# With Pabot for parallel execution
pabot --processes 4 --outputdir reports tests/

# Syntax check only
robot --dryrun tests/
```

This will execute the tests in the `tests/` directory and save the results in the `reports/` directory.

### 3. Generating Allure Reports

To generate an Allure report after test execution, use the following command:

```bash
allure generate reports -o reports/allure-report
```

### 4. Viewing Allure Reports

To serve the Allure report in a browser, use:

```bash
allure serve reports
```

This command will start a local server and automatically open the report in your default browser.

## CI Integration

The project is set up to run tests automatically via GitHub Actions, with results being uploaded as an artifact and a Slack notification sent (if configured).

## Notes

- **FIXED**: All syntax errors that prevented the TAF from running have been resolved
- Tests now support both headless (CI) and GUI (development) browser modes
- Use `--dryrun` flag for quick syntax validation without browser automation
- Ensure that the browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) are installed and available in your system's PATH
- Update the credentials and variables in the `variables/global_variables.robot` and `variables/login_data.json` files as needed
- Adjust the browser settings and other configurations in `variables/config.robot`
- See `RUNNING_TESTS.md` for detailed configuration options
